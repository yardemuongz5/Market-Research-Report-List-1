<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sinus Dilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Sinus Dilation</li><li>No-Balloon Sinus Dilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sinus dilator market is primarily divided into two types: balloon sinus dilation and no-balloon sinus dilation. Balloon sinus dilation involves the use of a balloon catheter that is inserted into the sinus cavity and inflated to widen the passage, providing relief from sinus obstruction. In contrast, no-balloon sinus dilation techniques may utilize other instruments or methods, such as manual dilation or microdebriders, to achieve similar outcomes without the use of balloons. Both methods aim to enhance sinus drainage and alleviate symptoms.</p></p>
