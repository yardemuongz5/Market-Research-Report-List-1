<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Screw Conveyors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shafted Convoyers</li><li>Shaftless Convoyers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horizontal screw conveyors are vital for bulk material handling, and they come in two primary types: shafted and shaftless. Shafted conveyors use a central shaft to support the auger flights, making them suitable for a wide range of materials. They offer durability and efficiency for heavy-duty applications. In contrast, shaftless conveyors eliminate the need for a central shaft, allowing for the transport of sticky or sludgy materials without clogging. This design enhances flexibility and eases maintenance, catering to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
